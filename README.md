# Aki's name app

This is my implementation of the dev-academy-2021 Name Application exercise.
I enjoyed the exercise. It provided nice challenges that required thinking to solve and weren't too difficult for me to overcome.

I had basic understanding of React from before, so I opted to use node.js and React.
I'm also pretty new to developing with no formal education, so I felt I didn't have enough time to veer outside of javascript.

I had no prior experience with CSS and styling webpages so the look of the app is very basic.
Styling was done in a mad rush as I was running out of time.
